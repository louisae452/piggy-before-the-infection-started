# Piggy before the infection started.

Piggy before the infection started is a TV show which has been running for over four years and has been published over YouTube.

His creator, SuperJakeJoseCat, started a YouTube channel when he was 8 and has been adding content to it since. As the years went by, the content in the channel has become very varied and sometimes it is difficult to find specific videos.

With this in mind, SuperJakeJoseCat would like to have a platform in which fans of Piggy before the infection started can find the content they search for easily.

However, due to the amount of content that SuperJakeJoseCat has produced in these four years and the need for the webpage to be updated very regularly, it was soon clear that the task ahead may be better suited for a framework such as Django.

With this in mind, it was decided that the scope of this project will be on providing a prototype of what will eventually become the website and its scope will be reduced to the first three seasons of the main Piggy before the infection started series.

## Business goals.

- To increase visibility of the series and gain new viewers.
- To make it easy for fans to navigate to the episode they desire.
- To inform fans of facts they may not know about the series.
- To put out news of upcoming Piggy events.
- To have a platform from which to launch Piggy before the infection started spin offs.
- To showcase animating skills for potential commissions.

## User needs.

- To be able to easily navigate to a specific episode.
- To have a platform where they can follow the latest developments in the series.

## Design.

The web page will consist of three pages. They will all be responsive to large, medium and small screen sizes.

All the pages will contain a navigation bar which link to each of the pages and a footer with links to the series social media.

### The home page.

The home page will contain a brief introduction to the series, a section in which users can find out more about the series by going on to its Wikijpedia pages or play the associated Roblox game, a section to show the award nominations the series has received, a news section, and a section to go to the gallery or send a message to the creator.

### The gallery.

## Changes to the design.

### Home page for medium screens.

The original layout for the description of the series was the similar as that for small screens. It was found that the layout adopted for larger screes was more adequate.

INSERT NEW WIREFRAME

### Gallery page.

For larger and medium screens, it was decided that six episodes per line, instead of the original four (for larger screens) and two(for medium screens) was more suitable.

For smaller screens, it was found that a vertical approach would make the page far too long and create user frustration. Instead, a horizontal scroll bar for the episodes in each season was adopted.

In addition, it was decided that buttons to navigate to each of the seasons in the page would look too chunky, so they were transformed into more discreate links at the top and bottom of each of the season sections.

INSERT NEW WIREFRAME

All the pages got the addition of two bottoms at the end of the page to navigate to the other two pages easily.

### Success page.
A  success page was created to be shown on successful submission of the form.

INSERT WIREFRAME.


## Typography and colour scheme.

The bangers type was chosen for the titles, while risque will be used for the main text.

The colour scheme was selected with purple as the main tone to keep in line with SuperJakeJoseCat’s branding, while the complementary forest green and mint green were chosen for the text in order to provide adequate contrast while being gentle in the eye for users with light sensitivity.
