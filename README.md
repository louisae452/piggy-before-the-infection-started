# Piggy before the infection started.

Piggy before the infection started is a TV show which has been running for over four years. The show has been published over You Tube.

His creator, SuperJakeJoseCat, started a YouTube channel when he was 8 and has been adding content to it since. As the years went by, the content in the channel has become very varied and sometimes it is difficult to find specific videos.

With this in mind, SuperJakeJoseCat would like to have a platform in which fans of Piggy before the infection started can find the content they search for easily.

However, due to the amount of content that SuperJakeJoseCat has produced in these four years and the need for the webpage to be updated very regularly, it was soon clear that the task ahead may be better suited for a framework such as Django.

With this in mind, it was decided that the scope of this project will be on providing a prototype of what will eventually become the website and its scope will be reduced to the first three sessions of the main Piggy before the infection started series.
